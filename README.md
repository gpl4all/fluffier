fluffier
========

this project named after my dog named: Fluffy, she is very fluffy and i hope she more fluffier than she is now.

goal of this project is to develop application for Blackberry OS10 platform, using c as programming language as a backend and will utilized available open source tools available in Blackberry OS10 platform. there's also possibility usage of other programming language such as C++ and toolkit like Blackberry Cascade and Qt on front end side, depends on whois willing and capable to help me on this project.

he code generated inside this project is covered by GPL v2 license, the other components will have their own license, so who ever wishes to do anything with this project, please read GPL v2 licensed, and other component licenses.

basic idea of fluffier (from now on i will refer the application by it's name) is to have secure storage that is also convinient to use to store most important data and exchanging that data.

depedency:
- openssl
- zlib or other compression library
- Blackberry OS10 NDK
- that's all? sure? no, i'm not, will add more if necessary


no code as of from now, i have to create system specification and & design first.

al be bak!
