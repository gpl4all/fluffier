fluffier
========

this project named after my dog named: Fluffy, she is very fluffy and i hope she more fluffier than she is now.

goal of this project is to develop application for Blackberry OS10 platform, using C as programming language as a backend and will utilized available open source tools available in Blackberry OS10 platform. there's also possibility usage of other programming language such as C++ and toolkit like Blackberry Cascade and Qt on front end side, depends on whois willing and capable to help me on this project.

he code generated inside this project is covered by GPL v2 license, the other components will have their own license, so who ever wishes to do anything with this project, please read GPL v2 licensed, and other component licenses.

basic idea of fluffier (from now on i will refer the application by it's name) is to an application running on BlackBerry 10 devices to capture GPS location data (specially) when there are no radio/data coverage and all data will stored locally and later can be uploaded to host(s), and converted to KML format that can be processed through any avail software to visualized movements that was tracked.

this idea is not my original idea but from a software (if i'm not mistaken) GPS Tracker that run on BlackBerry OS6/7 platform that i used it to track my expedition to one of remote area of Indonesia: Raja Ampat, and the result of this location tracking data can be seen on my blog:

as far as i know, there's no such application available on BlackBerry OS10 platform, so i decided to create this project and with the help of some friends in one BlackBerry Messenger Group that are mostly session developer, i really hope that this project will actually can achives this goal.

software dependencies:
  - BlackBerry OS10 Native SDK: this is no other way around to create BlackBerry OS10 native application
  - BlackBerry Cascade, Qt, QML, C++ (u named it...): to develop UI parts (or more extreme, BlackBerry WebWorks) :D
  - pure C language: will be my tools to create backend application
  - sqlite, json_parser, couchdb, libxml2, or expat: as data storage engine
  - zlib or other compression library: if there's a need of data compression
  - openssl: for data encryption
  - that's all? sure? no, i'm not, will add more if necessary

no code as of from now, i have to create system specification and & design first.

al be bak!
