this project named after my dog named: Fluffy, she is very fluffy and i hope she more fluffier than she is now.

goal of this project is to develop application for Blackberry OS10 platform, using c as programming language as a backend and will utilized available open source tools available in Blackberry OS10 platform. there's also possibility usage of other programming language such as C++ and toolkit like Blackberry Cascade and Qt on front end side, depends on whois willing and capable to help me on this project.

basic idea of fluffier (from now on i will refer the application by it's name) is to have secure storage that is also convinient to use to store most important data and exchanging that data.

al be bak!
